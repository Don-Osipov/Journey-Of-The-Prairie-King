# Journey-Of-The-Prarie-King
The game was made with the help of Willie Chen

This model is based on the minigame from Stardew Valley called Journey of the Praire King. Journey of the Praire King is a top down shooter, you start with 2 lives and try to survive for 1 minute while enemies come at you from 4 sides.

Although the .nlogo file can be opened to see the underlying code, to actually run the game, you must have NetLogo installed on your system.
